# Celebrating Differentiability
"Celebrating Differentiability" is an innovative tool designed to bridge the gap between differently-abled individuals and technology. Our goal is to create a more inclusive world where everyone has equal access to information and opportunities, regardless of their abilities. To achieve this, we have created a versatile tool that offers multiple features to cater to the needs and preferences of the consumers.
