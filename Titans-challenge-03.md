Team TITANS

We have to build trust in the network for that we have to verify the credential very strictly so we thought:-

Digilocker

Why Digi locker why not any other?

Now a day everyone has a Digi locker and every government institution and educational board provides all the certificates and documents in a Digi locker. It become a very good place to verify the user and get user records and all issues documents.

How we implemented it?

At the very beginning when the user signs up for our platform he/she have to connect ther Digi locker to our platform and we fetch the all issued document from the digilocker database and if any document which we not found which is required we ask the user to upload it manually

What it benefits?

If we get all user data it is 100% correct because we fetch directly from the government database which help provider to fast there process of like document verification in job and loans and they dont have to verify all the data which help the consumer to get a good user experience.

Sign-up system

What do you mean by sign-up system?

We already had seen on many platforms and websites when we want to create an account an option comes up like creating an account with Google, or Github like that we use that type of system with our partner organization which provides us with courses and training.

How does it work?

If a user signup platform using our sign-up system It shares its data from our platform and if a user buys any course it gets reflected in his profile after completion of the course provider easily sends a digital credential to the user in his profile

QR Code

Why QR?

We had seen effective use of QR. Our Platform will provide users with a QR in which his/her personal or regional data along with profile info will be stored where all of his/her certificates or accomplishments will be stored, whenever or wherever the user needs his data for other uses he would simply use QR to fetch his data. Which is fetched from his Digilocker Database or manually uploaded data on our platform or those certificates that the user earned from our website after completion of the course.

Overview of Our project

At starting we see a landing page in which a user or an organization can sign up by entering their credential after that user is directed to his account in which user can access all the jobs, courses, and training.

If users want to buy any courses or apply to job he will redirected to the provider platform where he can login with Our platform which helps the provider to track his progress and reflect all the courses he buy and apply for courses in his profile. And all completed and ongoing courses can seen in the library section.

There is a resume section in which user can add there project and other detail he can add delete the certifcates according to there needs.
