   a. The problem that the proposed solution aims to address is the lack of accessibility and transparency in accessing scholarship and grant opportunities for education. Many students face financial barriers to accessing higher education, and scholarships and grants are a critical means of overcoming these barriers. However, the process of discovering and applying for these opportunities is often time-consuming, complex, and can be confusing for many students. This can create a significant challenge for those seeking financial aid for education.

   On the provider side, the process of publishing scholarship and grant opportunities is also complex and can be a manual and cumbersome process. The lack of a standardized and centralized platform for providers to publish these opportunities can limit the visibility and accessibility of these opportunities, making it harder for students to find the opportunities they are looking for.

   Implementing a scholarships/grants provider platform involves several steps, including defining the purpose of the platform, creating a user-friendly interface, designing the application and selection process, and establishing the necessary administrative infrastructure to manage the scholarships/grants program.

   The effectiveness of a scholarships/grants provider platform will depend on several factors, such as the quality of the program, the ease of use of the platform, and the reach of its marketing and outreach efforts.
